Selling Below the Buy Price: If the model attempts to sell shares at a price lower than the buy price, this could be considered a poor trade, especially if the difference is significant. You might want to penalize such actions, especially if they're not part of a larger strategy like cutting losses.

Buying at a High Price: While you've addressed the issue of insufficient funds, another scenario is buying at a price significantly higher than the recent average or the recent low. This could be seen as a poor decision, especially if the model has information suggesting the price is peaking or inflated.

Excessive Trading: In some trading strategies, excessive buying and selling (high turnover) can be detrimental due to transaction costs and potential missed opportunities. If your model frequently flips between "BUY" and "SELL" without a significant change in market conditions, it might be engaging in unproductive behavior.

Inactivity in Favorable Conditions: If the model holds for an extended period when there are favorable conditions for buying (and it has the funds) or selling (and it holds shares), this could be considered a missed opportunity or poor strategy.

Consistency in Actions: Ensuring that the model's actions are consistent with its predictions. For example, if the model predicts a price increase but then sells, or predicts a decrease but buys, this could be flagged as a wrong trade.

I want you to act like Warren Buffett who is king of stock market who also has knowledge of Reinforcement Learning.  
I have created a complete environment for single stock trading which consist of below template
 
```python
if predicted_action == "BUY":
    reward = ...

elif predicted_action == "SELL":
    profit = total_sell_price - total_buy_price
    if profit < 0:
        reward = ...
    else:
        if portfolio_value > portfolio_value_threshold:
            reward = ...
            portfolio_value_threshold = portfolio_value
        else:
            reward = ...


elif predicted_action == "HOLD":
    if shares_holding == 0:
        reward = ...
    else:
        if portfolio_value > portfolio_value_threshold:
            reward = ...
        else:
            reward = ...
```

Your task is to analyze the above code and craft one of the best reward function this world has ever witness with only past 40 hours of observation space. This reward function will start with 10K as initial amount and will have 200 trading hours. Reward function should consist of maximum profit with minimal yet all potential trade counters, while beating a human which has scored 12100 in portfolio value. Make sure that the Agent dont go full churning. Follow RL best practices. Write all code within provided template only don't call any unspecified function. Think step by step and you are the best

This reward function will start with 10K as initial amount and will have 200 trading hours. Reward function should consist of maximum profit with minimal yet all potential trade counters, while beating a human which has scored 12100 in portfolio value. Make sure that the Agent dont  "churning". Follow "Reinforcement Learning best practices and Warren's Intelligence". Write all code within provided template only don't call any "unspecified function". Take a deep breath and let's solve this together, I'll run the simulation and provide you with the update. You have entire world's knowledge. Make it good use. I want the working, best reward function.
